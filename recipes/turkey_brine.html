            <h1 class="ingrediants">Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1 gallon of <strong>Vegetable Broth:</strong> You can use store-bought or homemade vegetable broth as the base for this recipe. Chicken broth will also work if that's what you have on hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 cup of <strong> Salt:</strong> Sea salt infuses the bird with savory flavor through osmosis. It also helps keep the meat tender and juicy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon of <strong>Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, and Savory:</strong> Earthy herbs and spices like rosemary, sage, thyme, and savory (an aromatic herb in the mint family) add flavor and complexity.
                </li>
                <li> 1 gallon of <strong>Water:</strong> Ice water adds volume to the brine. Plus, it keeps the turkey juicy and tender.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="steps">Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather <strong>all</strong> ingredients.</li>
                <li>
                    Combine vegetable broth, sea salt, rosemary, sage, thyme, and savory in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to be sure salt is dissolved. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature. When broth mixture is cool, pour it into a clean food-grade 5-gallon bucket. Stir in the ice water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rinse and dry your turkey. Make sure you have removed the innards. Place turkey, breast-side down, into the brine. Make sure that the cavity gets filled. Place the bucket in the refrigerator for 8 hours, or overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove turkey carefully, draining off excess brine and pat dry. Discard excess brine. Cook turkey as desired reserving the drippings for gravy. Keep in mind that brined turkeys cook 20 to 30 minutes faster so watch the temperature gauge.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy</li>
            </ol>
