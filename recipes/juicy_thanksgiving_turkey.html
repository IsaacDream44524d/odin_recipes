            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather <strong>all</strong> ingredients.
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roaster with sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap around turkey.
                Chopped vegetables, seasonings, sliced citrus and an uncooked turkey on a stone surface.
                </li>
                <li>Stir parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Rub herb mixture into turkey cavity, then stuff with orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery. Tie turkey legs together with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body.</li>
                <li>Place turkey on the foil in the roasting pan. Pour champagne and chicken broth over turkey, making sure to get some liquid in the cavity.</li>
                <li>Bring aluminum foil up and over the top of turkey and seal; try to keep the foil from touching the turkey.</li>
                <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 2 ½ to 3 hours. Uncover turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 to 60 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and Enjoy.</li>
