    <h1>Cranberry Sauce</h1>
    <p>
        This Cranberry Sauce recipe combines fresh cranberries, sugar and orange juice for a quick and
        easy side that adds <strong>a burst of tangy flavor</strong> to your Thanksgiving holiday meal.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            12 ounces of <strong>Fresh Cranberry:</strong> Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup of <strong> White Sugar:</strong> White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup of <strong>Orange Juice</strong> All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.
        </li>
    </ul>
